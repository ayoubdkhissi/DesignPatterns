# C#10 Design Patterns
Fully functioning sample code for my C#10 Design Patterns course over at Pluralsight.  The samples cover all 23 Gang of Four design patterns, with a real-life example for each pattern.

# How to use
Each design pattern is organized within its own dedicated C# console project. Each project comprises of two key files:

- "Implementation.cs": which includes the complete implementation of the pattern, including all necessary interfaces and classes.
- "Program.cs": a comprehensive test of the pattern implementation, which serves as an example of its usage.

To run an example of a particular pattern, set the corresponding project as the "Startup Project" in Visual Studio, then launch the project.
